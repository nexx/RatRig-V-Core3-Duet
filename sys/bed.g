; Called on G32 to tram the gantry to the bed
;
; NOTE: With a 3 point kinematic bed, we specify the pivot points as the
; leadscrew locations. We probe as close as possible to those locations
; and RRF will calculate the corrections.

; Pivot positions:
;   Front Left : X-12.50, Y-12.50
;   Rear Middle: X150.00, Y312.50
;   Front Right: X312.50, Y-12.50
;
; Probe offset:  X-29.75, Y-13.50
